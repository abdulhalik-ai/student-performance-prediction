# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## About the Project
Student academic performance depends on factors such as study hours,
attendance, and previous exam marks. This project predicts whether
a student will pass or fail using machine learning techniques.

This project is created for educational and learning purposes.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze student data and predict
student performance using a machine learning classification model.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes student-related inputs such as study hours,
attendance percentage, and previous marks. The output label indicates
Pass (1) or Fail (0).

---

## Machine Learning Approach
- Supervised Learning
- Classification
- Logistic Regression algorithm

---

## How the Project Works
1. Load the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train the Logistic Regression model
4. Test the model accuracy
5. Predict student performance for new inputs

---

## Output
The model predicts whether the student will Pass or Fail based on
the given input values.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple and practical application of
machine learning in the education domain. It helps beginners
understand classification models.

---

## Future Scope
- Include more features like assignment scores
- Improve accuracy using advanced ML algorithms
- Deploy as a web application
